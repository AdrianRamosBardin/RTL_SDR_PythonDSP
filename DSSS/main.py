#Important note: Rigth now the system has not been proven to work with RTL-SDR
#                The reason for that is I dont have a good frontend for the GNSS (L1) band

#Update: I dont think I will use the RTL-SDR anymore, is preatty crappy for this. It can be used but better SDR are preatty cheap these days
#        Also this 'pyrtlsdr' does not support other common SDR, so upgradability is garbage. Conclusi√≥n the GNSS correlator works :), but hardware is really crappy
